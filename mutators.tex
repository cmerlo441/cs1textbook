\chapter{Mutators and Parameterized Constructors}
\label{chapter:mutators}

\minitoc

In Chapters \ref{chapter:classes} and \ref{chapter:default-constructors} we developed enough of a \texttt{Point} class to be able to instantiate \texttt{Point} objects and see what they store.  But right now, all they can store is $(0,0)$.  In this chapter, we see how to customize the values stored in the object.

\section{Mutators}

Once an object has been created, the secure way to allow an outside class to change the values stored in the instance variables is to write a \mintinline{java}{public} \textit{mutator} method.
